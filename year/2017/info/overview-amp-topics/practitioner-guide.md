### Highlighted events for practitioners at IEEE VIS 2017 

IEEE VIS is known as the major research conference in the field of visual data analysis. Yet, the conference is not only interesting for researchers but comes with many events that are interesting for practitioners as well. On Sunday and Monday you can choose among 9 different tutorials, 11 workshop and two co-located symposia. The main conference takes place Tuesday to Friday with four parallel sessions featuring talks on the latest research results in the field as well as panel discussions and the supporters exhibition.
